# calculator_es6_ts

Clasic and casual calculator but done with ES6 and TypesScript

## Getting Started

Just execute, the .ts file is already compiled.

```
index.html
```

### To compile by yourself

Install TypeScript globaly
```
npm install -g typescript
```

And create a tsconfig.json
```
tsc --init
```

Uncomment the strict option to avoid compilation problems with ECMAS 6
```
"strict": true  
```

$ tsc
```
in your CMD
