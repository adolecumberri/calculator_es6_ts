# calculator done with ES6 and TypeScript

Clasic and casual calculator but done with ES6 and TypesScript.

## Getting Started

Just execute the index.html, the .ts file is already compiled.

```
index.html
```

### To compile it by yourself

Install TypeScript globaly
```
npm install -g typescript
```

And create a tsconfig.json
```
tsc --init (not tsc init)
```

Uncomment the strict option to avoid compilation problems with ECMAS 6
```
"strict": true  
```

Each time you finish working in the .ts file, you need to recompile it, just write 
```
$ tsc
```
in your CMD
